### Comments regarding the current status

- Database extracted from De Laurentiis et al (2023). Data comprises estimated food loss and waste along the chain by product disaggregation level for each of the EU Member States for the period 2003-2020. Estimated data are available in a public domain area: [Joint Research Centre Data Catalogue].
Drivers according to the literature and extracted from open access sources, as an example: 
Population is available at: [Population on 1 January by age and sex].
Real GDP per capita is available at: [Real GDP per capita].
Unemployment rate is available at: [Total unemployment rate].
The databases have been merged, and preliminary statistical analysis has been conducted, along with the initial stages of econometric analysis yielding some preliminary results. 

- Cap context and result indicators were downloaded and compared as an important input for the definition of the Safe and Just operating space.

- 	The FADN data received in April 2024 are by default split in organic (fully converted) and conventional to permit a statistical analysis of productivity and intensity differences between these two farm specializations and to generate input data for the FarmDyn model. 

- Improved application of lancet diet shifts in raw product models; Application for EFSA consumer data ongoing. Food intake quantities stem from the German National Nutrition Survey II (NVSII) from 2006 with 13,926 randomly selected participants, representative of the German-speaking population, between the ages of 14 and 80 questioned in 24h-recalls about their intake of food and beverages (Brombach et al., 2006; Krems et al., 2006). The participants were selected randomly in around 500 municipalities and are representative of the German-speaking population. The 24h-recalls are available at EFSAâ€™s comprehensive food consumption database (EFSA, 2023). 

- This dataset comprises spatial biophysical data regarding aspect, elevation and slope derived from [Global and European Digital Elevation Model (COP-DEM)] and topsoil properties derived from [Topsoil physical properties for Europe] to the NUTS regions across Europe. The dataset consists of two files, each corresponding to a different level of NUTS coding (NUTS 2/3).
