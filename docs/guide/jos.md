### Farm income

#### FADN spatial

##### Description
FADN subsidies are part of farm income. As these data is only accessible at farm level, a down scaling approach has been developed and applied.

Data is protected (more than 15 obs. per observation unit).

##### Main data sources to produce the data

* Individual FADN data
* Farm Structure Spatial Units (FSU) established in the VERIFY project ([link_FSU])
* CAPDIS for information on land use and yields (Britz, W., Witzke, P.  (2014). CAPRI model documentation 2014)
    * Information on land use in the FSU is calculated calculated through the Land Area Prediction model (LAPM), based on the methods of Lamboni et al. (2016: Lamboni, M. R. Koeble, A. Leip (2016). Multi-scale land-use disaggregation modelling: concept and application to EU countries. Environmental Modelling & Software 82, 183-217. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2016.04.028), and assessing its accuracy (Leip et al., 2017: Leip, A., Koeble, R., Rotllan-Puig, X., 2017. Land Area Prediction model (LAPM) Accuracy Assessment. European Commission, Ispra (VA), Italy. https://doi.org/10.2760/624482). They include available data of crop areas from the Farm Structure Survey 2010 at a 10 km x 10 km grid, developing a methodology to gap-fill missing data which was filtered out by confidentiality rules (Bujnowska et al., 2019: Bujnowska, A., Gomez-Prieto, O., Kloek, W., Koeble, R., Leip, D., Martinez-Solano, D., Ramos, H. (2019). Disseminating European data at farm level while protecting confidentiality: scientific use files and homogeneous spatial units, in: International Conference on Agricultural Statistics, New Delhi.).

##### Reports

* Estimation approaches to downscale policy information from FADN (Chapter 5 in D3.1 Report on stocktake of requirements and technical specifications for the LUM policy database - [LAMASUS project]) [link_explanation1]

##### Article

Article is prepared for submission.

##### Temporal and spatial scale

Spatial scale: EU-wide for all countries contributing to the EU-FADN. 

Temporal scale: depending on progress. Actually 2001-2020 each second year.
