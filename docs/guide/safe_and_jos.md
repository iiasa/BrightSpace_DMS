## *Farm diversification indicator*

##### *Description*

Creation of a farm diversification indicator based on the distribution of three farm resources: land, labor and capital.
To measure the degree of diversification per farm and year, the Shannon-Weaver Index for each of the three resource categories is applied. Contrary to former studies which used the Simpson or Gini index, the index will not only account for the richness (number of activities) but also the evenness (distribution of available resources among the activities) of a farm diversification. Using the Shannon index allows for more rare activities to affect the index in a similar way than dominant farm activities. This allows for an understanding of changes in resource patterns that have not been determined yet.

## *Current application: examining field structural change*

##### *Description*

The structure of agricultural fields changes over time based on institutional and farm economics rationales. These field changes can impact environmental and social outcomes such as biodiversity, farm output, and income. Hence, we employ the geospatial dataset of the German federal state of Lower Saxony from 2012 to 2023 to investigate field structural changes. We investigate changes in the size, shape and number of agricultural fields within defined landscape boundaries over time, the heterogeneity of change across regions and how these relate to change in the number of farms and average farm size. We use mapping and statistical techniques to show the outcomes of the regionally heterogeneous field structural change values and their relationship to farm development variables from various data sources.
