# Aligning SJOS to thematic areas and indicator domains 

Based on a review of the Safe Operating Spaces (SOS) and Just Operating Spaces (JOS) concepts, a comparison and alignment with EU policy targets, and expert consultations, a set of 12 thematic areas and 34 indicator domains was developed. The SOS components closely align with concepts in the literature on planetary boundaries, with the notable exceptions of ocean acidification and ozone layer depletion. For JOS, significant overlap was found between the literature and EU policies, particularly in the areas of food and nutrition security and health.

Economy-related topics were divided into two thematic areas. The "General Economy" area addresses the relative position of agriculture compared to other sectors in terms of employment, value-added, wages, and input prices. Topics specific to the agricultural sector, such as farm incomes, economic viability, future prospects, and farm structure, are encompassed within the broader thematic area of "Farm resilience." The resulting thematic areas and indicator domains are detailed below.
