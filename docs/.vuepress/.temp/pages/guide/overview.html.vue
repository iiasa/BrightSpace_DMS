<p>An overview of dimensions and indicators of the Safe and Just Operating Spaces (SJOS) can be found in a report (Deliverable D1.1 (D01) An operational concept for dimensions and indicators of the SJOS <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/13891663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link D1.1</a>).
This report introduces an SJOS framework designed specifically for EU agriculture, integrating environmental, economic, and social dimensions to track progress toward political objectives. The framework's development involved a design phase comprising a comprehensive literature review, alignment with EU policy goals, and consultations with experts. The proposed SJOS encompasses 12 thematic areas and 34 indicator domains, although the specific indicators are yet to be finalized.</p>

<p>If you like to have an overview of mpacts of agricultural production decisions on the safe and just operating space, a systematic literature review has been carried out (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/qopen/qoae027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a>).
This study systematically reviews the literature to identify connections between agricultural production decisions and the SJOS framework. It focuses on three categories of production decisions: on-farm technology usage, farm structural change, and field structural change. The study examines the mechanisms through which these categories impact SJOS and evaluates the scope of existing evidence.</p>
